# Model Integrity & Audit Report

This document outlines the "Why and How" of the NexusHealth's model architecture, specifically focusing on data integrity, validation, and the prevention of overfitting.

## 1. Executive Summary
Following a comprehensive audit of the ML pipeline, several critical fixes were implemented to ensure that diagnostic accuracies reflect real-world clinical reliability rather than "fake" numbers caused by data leakage or overfitting.

## 2. Model Performance Benchmarks (Verified)

| Disease | Accuracy | Model Type | Status | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diabetes** | 86.7% | XGBoost | ✅ Active | Stable generalization on BRFSS data. |
| **Heart Disease** | 93.1% | XGBoost | ✅ Active | Aligned with 13-feature Cleveland schema. |
| **Liver Disease** | 88.4% | XGBoost | ✅ Active | **Corrected** from 99.9% after leakage fix. |
| **Lungs Health** | 96.8% | XGBoost | ✅ Active | Highly reliable on symptom correlation. |
| **Kidney Disease** | N/A | Placeholder | ⚠️ Disabled | Removed due to insufficient data (66% accuracy). |

## 3. The "Why and How" of the Audit

### A. The Data Leakage Fix (Liver Model)
*   **Problem**: The initial training script performed upsampling *before* the train/test split. This caused duplicate records to appear in both sets, allowing the model to "memorize" patients rather than learn patterns.
*   **Solution**: Implemented a "Split-First" architecture. 
    1.  Divide raw data into 80% Train / 20% Test.
    2.  Apply `RobustScaler` to the training set and transform the test set.
    3.  Upsample *only* the training set to handle class imbalance.
*   **Result**: Accuracy dropped from a fake 99.9% to an **honest 88.4%**.

### B. Preventing Overfitting
*   **Early Stopping & Regularization**: All models use `XGBoost` with `eval_metric='logloss'`. XGBoost's built-in regularization (gamma, alpha, lambda) prevents the model from becoming too complex and fitting to noise.
*   **Stratified Splitting**: We use stratified splits to ensure that the ratio of "Disease" vs "Healthy" patients is the same in both training and testing sets, preventing biased evaluations.

### C. Addressing Underfitting (Kidney Case)
*   **Observation**: The Kidney model achieved only 66% accuracy.
*   **Root Cause**: Underfitting due to "Small Data" (only 15 records in the training set).
*   **Action**: In healthcare, an underfit model is a liability. We have **disabled** this model and reverted it to a safe fallback (Healthy constant) until a larger dataset (>500 records) is available.

## 4. Feature Alignment & Scalability
*   **Heart Disease**: Re-aligned the model to the **13-feature Cleveland Schema**. This ensures the UI input fields (Chest Pain, Thalassemia, etc.) map directly to the model's mathematical expectations.
*   **Scaling**: All models now use either `StandardScaler` or `RobustScaler` to ensure that features like Blood Pressure (140) don't overpower features like Gender (0/1).

## 5. Deployment Notice
All active models have been re-verified through the `backend/test_predictions.py` suite. The system is currently running on **Validated Honesty** mode.
