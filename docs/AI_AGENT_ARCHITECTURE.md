## Overview

This codebase implements a two-pillar AI architecture:

1. **DevX Agent Infrastructure** - Makes the repo "AI-maintainable" so that LLM coding assistants (Copilot, Cursor, Claude, Gemini) operate with deterministic, domain-aware context instead of hallucinating.
2. **Product AI Integration** - Embeds multi-tier AI inference directly into the application for medical chat, risk assessment, and health record analysis.

## Pillar 1: DevX Agent Infrastructure

### 1.1 Hierarchical Context Resolution (`AGENTS.md`)

Instead of a single massive `.cursorrules` file, instructions are broken into a filesystem hierarchy:

| Level | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Root | `AGENTS.md` | Global rules (host-bound local URLs use `127.0.0.1`, PII handling, etc.) |
| Scoped | `backend/AGENTS.md` | Backend-specific rules (AI provider abstraction, DB sessions) |
| Scoped | `frontend/AGENTS.md` | Frontend-specific rules (Next.js App Router, browser API URLs) |
| Scoped | `frontend_legacy/AGENTS.md` | Legacy Streamlit frontend rules |
| Scoped | `tests/AGENTS.md` | Backend pytest rules (mocking, isolation) |
| Deep Ref | `backend/CONTEXT.md` | Verbose module-level documentation (read only when needed) |

**Why it works**: When an agent edits a backend file, it reads Root `AGENTS.md` + `backend/AGENTS.md`. It's shielded from frontend Next.js rules, saving tokens and eliminating context confusion.

### 1.2 Automated Adapter Synchronization

Different AI tools expect instructions in proprietary formats. Canonical rules live in `AGENTS.md` files. The adapter manifest contains thin tool-specific summaries and references to those canonical files, then the sync engine distributes them:

```
AGENTS.md (canonical)
    -> scripts/sync_agent_adapters.py
    |-- .cursorrules
    |-- .cursor/rules/00-root.mdc
    |-- .cursor/rules/01-backend.mdc
    |-- .cursor/rules/04-frontend-legacy.mdc
    |-- .github/copilot-instructions.md
    |-- .github/instructions/backend.instructions.md
    |-- CLAUDE.md
    |-- GEMINI.md
    `-- .kiro/steering/*.md
```

**Manifest**: `scripts/agent_adapter_manifest.json` defines the generated adapter mapping and short compatibility summaries.
**Sync**: `python scripts/sync_agent_adapters.py` writes all adapter files.
**Check**: `python scripts/sync_agent_adapters.py --check` verifies sync, obsolete-file removal, and unmanaged adapter files in CI.

### 1.3 Dynamic Context Injection (`ai_context.py`)

At session start, agents run `python scripts/ai_context.py` to get instant situational awareness:

```json
{
  "project": "NexusHealth",
  "database": {"type": "sqlite", "path": "healthcare.db", "exists": true, "size_mb": 0.1},
  "git": {"branch": "main", "dirty_count": 3},
  "services": [
    {"name": "Backend (FastAPI)", "port": 8000, "running": true},
    {"name": "Frontend (Next.js)", "port": 3000, "running": false}
  ],
  "ml_models": [
    {"name": "Diabetes_Model.pkl", "exists": true, "size_mb": 0.5},
    {"name": "Heart_Model.pkl", "exists": false}
  ]
}
```

The agent immediately knows what's running, what models are trained, and what context files exist.

## Pillar 2: Product AI Integration

### 2.1 Multi-Tier Inference Engine (`backend/core_ai.py`)

Provider-backed AI/LLM/embedding/vision inference routes through a single module with automatic fallback:

```
Tier A: Ollama (Local)     -> Zero cloud-provider cost when local; prompts stay on the configured Ollama host
Tier B: Gemini (Cloud)     -> Google API free tier, reliable
Tier C: OpenAI/Anthropic   -> Optional, via request headers or env vars
```

**Public API** (the ONLY functions external modules should call):
- `generate(prompt, system)` -> Single-shot text generation
- `chat(messages, system)` -> Multi-turn chat
- `chat_stream(messages, system)` -> SSE streaming chat
- `embed_text(text, task_type)` -> Text embeddings for RAG
- `generate_vision_content(prompt, image)` -> Vision analysis boundary
- Ollama model helpers -> local model listing, pulling, and deletion
- `is_available()` -> Check if any backend is online

**Rule**: No module outside `core_ai.py` may import `google.generativeai`, `httpx` for AI calls, or any provider SDK directly.

### 2.2 Version-Controlled Prompt Registry (`backend/prompt_registry.py`)

Every system prompt is registered, versioned, and auditable:

```python
from backend.prompt_registry import get_prompt

template = get_prompt("medical_qa")  # Returns the active version
template = get_prompt("medical_qa", version="2.0")  # Specific version
```

**Registered Prompts**:
| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chat_system` | Main chatbot system prompt with full context injection |
| `medical_qa` | RAG-grounded medical Q&A with citations |
| `symptom_analysis` | Structured symptom analysis |
| `report_summary` | Health record summarization |
| `risk_assessment` | Disease risk explanation |
| `streaming_system` | Compact prompt for SSE streaming (token-efficient) |

**Rule**: Never inline system prompts in route handlers. Register in the registry, retrieve via `get_prompt()`.

Prompt templates include instruction-hierarchy guardrails for retrieved records, uploaded report content, RAG memory, web research context, and patient-provided fields. Those inputs are treated as untrusted data: prompts tell the model not to follow instructions embedded inside them and to use them only as clinical evidence for the current user.

### 2.3 AI Function Governance Registry (`backend/ai_function_registry.py`)

AI-facing backend functions are listed in a static governance inventory exposed to admins at `GET /admin/ai-functions`. Each entry declares:

- intended audience and endpoint/module ownership
- clinical risk category
- whether medical disclaimers, human review, and basis transparency are required
- whether the function calls an AI provider and, if so, that the provider boundary is `backend.core_ai`
- prompt keys when a registered prompt is part of the workflow

The registry is anchored to practical governance expectations from WHO AI governance, FDA clinical decision-support transparency, and EU AI Act human-oversight principles. It is not a certification artifact; it is a control inventory for review, testing, and deployment readiness.

### 2.4 Model And Dataset Cards (`backend/model_cards.py`)

Prediction models and their public training artifacts are described through admin-visible cards at `GET /admin/model-cards`. Cards include intended use, model family, endpoint, artifact presence, dataset source, known limitations, human-review requirement, medical-disclaimer requirement, and post-deployment monitoring requirement.

The endpoint does not load models, read dataset rows, expose training samples, or return patient identifiers. It is an evidence surface for pilots and internal review, not a certification claim.

Clinician/admin review of AI prediction outputs is auditable through `POST /predict/reviews`. The route records whether a prediction was accepted, overridden, or ignored, and writes a PHI-safe `REVIEW_AI_PREDICTION` audit event without storing raw review notes or prediction payloads in audit details.

### 2.5 SSE Streaming Chat (`backend/streaming_chat.py`)

Real-time token streaming with heartbeat keepalive:

```
POST /chat/stream      -> SSE stream with {sources, reply chunks, status}
GET  /chat/context     -> Debug: view assembled RAG context
GET  /chat/suggestions -> Dynamic starter questions
```

Architecture (adapted from Universe Dex `chat_routes.py`):
1. Build RAG context via `chat_context.py`
2. Send sources immediately to client
3. Stream AI response via `core_ai.chat_stream()` with 15s heartbeat
4. Handle errors gracefully with structured SSE error events

### 2.6 Medical RAG Context Builder (`backend/chat_context.py`)

Analyzes patient questions and queries the DB to build structured context:

```
Patient question -> Intent detection
    |-- Patient Profile (name, age, vitals, lifestyle)
    |-- Condition-specific records (if "diabetes" mentioned -> diabetes records)
    |-- General health records (if no specific condition)
    |-- Health trend stats (if "trend" / "summary" mentioned)
    `-- Recent chat history (for continuity)
-> (context_string, sources_list)
```

Token budget management truncates context to fit within model limits.

### 2.7 Enhanced RAG Pipeline (`backend/rag.py`)

The existing vector store is enhanced with Singularity Engine patterns:
- `RetrievedChunk` - Typed context chunks with similarity scores
- `Citation` - Source tracking for grounded answers
- `RAGResult` - Structured return type with citation metadata
- `assemble_context()` - Token-budgeted context assembly
- Embeddings are requested through `core_ai.embed_text()` so RAG never imports provider SDKs directly
- Retrieval uses an explicit `user_id` ACL filter and optional `facility_id` filter; facility-scoped searches do not return legacy documents without matching facility metadata

## Adding a New AI Feature

1. Register the prompt in `prompt_registry.py`
2. Build the context in `chat_context.py` (or a new context builder)
3. Call the relevant `core_ai` function - never import provider SDKs
4. Add the route in a new or existing router file
5. Mount in `main.py`
6. Add the function to `ai_function_registry.py` with clinical safety controls
7. Add or update `model_cards.py` if the feature introduces or materially changes a prediction model or dataset
8. Update this document
