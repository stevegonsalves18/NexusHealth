NexusHealth — Version-Controlled Prompt Registry

Every prompt used in the system is registered, versioned, and auditable.
This prevents silent prompt drift and enables A/B testing of prompts.

Usage:
    from backend.prompt_registry import get_prompt, register_prompt

    # Get the active prompt
    template = get_prompt("medical_qa")

    # Register a new version
    register_prompt("medical_qa", version="2.0", template="You are a medical expert...")

Ported from Universe Dex Singularity AI Engine, adapted for healthcare domain.
